This model can readily be implemented in MEOR simulation programs to account for mass transfer and kinetics of microbial reactions in CO2-MEOR operations. Fugacity coefficients (Ï†i) in the proposed model were calculated using Predictive Peng-Robinson 78 (PPR78) and Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state (EOS).
